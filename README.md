#Background

####TipCalculator, ToDoApp, GridImageSearch, MyTwitterApp, MyTwitterApp2

I created these five apps as part of CodePath’s 8-week Android Observer Bootcamp. I also collaborated with two teammates on SFSweep (hosted by [terranlune](https://github.com/terranlune/SFSweep)). They represent my first weeks in Android development, starting from ground zero. I haven’t edited them since their original posting, except to include these readme files. (All of the readme files are identical, so you only need to read this one.) That means they’re simple and introductory, but they help me say something about the pace and quality of my progress. If you’ve come here by way of my resume, I hope you’ve concluded that I would be a smart and helpful teammate. Here are a few code-based data points to show how that helpfulness scales quickly. 

To that end, you’ll notice that the five apps increase in complexity as they go along. You’ll also see that they were mainly focused on non-cosmetic features. To help you track my development, I’ve listed below some of the key concepts the projects were designed to teach. I’ve also included some screenshots so you don’t have to fire up Eclipse or Android Studio if you don’t want to. 

In the meantime, I think three takeaways are worth mentioning, given my interest in a junior developer role. First, the bootcamp (and my work outside of it) helped me acquire the core of knowledge needed for entry-level Android positions. (I believe CodePath states that its course teaches 80% of the features common to all Android apps). Second, my growth was quick, structured and, ultimately, deep. Third--and perhaps best of all for illustrating my ability--I matched the pace of my mid- to senior-level developer classmates. Combined, I think these are especially promising outcomes. They suggest that I can be an effective teammate from the outset, and that’s encouraging. CodePath’s co-founder [was also encouraged](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/adam-brown/52/219/5bb).* I think your team could be, too, and I look forward to the conversation.

I consolidated screen shots from MyTwitterApp and MyTwitterApp2, as the latter refactored the former into a fragment-based implementation and added the ‘mentions’ tab, the user profile, and the ability to click on any tweet in the home timeline to access a third-party profile screen.
